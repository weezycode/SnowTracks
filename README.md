*To do this project I need to create the following pages:*

   * *the home page where the list of figures will appear;*
   * *the page for creating a new figure;*
   * *the edit page of a figure*;
   * *the presentation page of a figure (containing the common discussion space around a figure);*
   * *the page login;* 
   * *the page register;*
   * *the page forgetPassword*;
   * *the page new password;*
