# SnowTricks
The objective of this project is to create a collaborative snowboarding website to promote this sport to the general public and the learning of tricks.
To do this project I need to create the following pages:
    -the home page where the list of figures will appear;
    -the page for creating a new figure;
    -the edit page of a figure;
    -the presentation page of a figure (containing the common discussion space around a figure);
    -the page login; 
    -the page register;
    -the page forgetPassword;
    -the page new password;
